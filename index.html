        <p id="about">
            <br>
            <br> Hello, Iâ€™m Aliza Batool, a passionate and driven Frontend Developer<br> with a solid expertise
             in TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. My journey in web development is marked by a continuous pursuit of knowledge
            and excellence. Currently, I am a student in the GIAIC program, where I am not only refining my
            existing skills but also embracing new technologies and methodologies that are shaping the future of web 
            development.
        <br>
        <br>
        My approach to development is grounded in the belief that great user experiences start with clean,
         maintainable code and an eye for detail. I take pride in crafting interfaces that are not only
          aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional and responsive across all devices. 
        I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and adopt the latest industry trends and best practices.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through my academic and practical experiences, I have developed a deep understanding of how to turn complex 
        ideas into seamless digital experiences. Whether working independently or as part
         of a collaborative team, I bring a proactive mindset and a problem-solving attitude to every project.
         <br>
         <br>
         As I continue to grow in this dynamic field, I am excited to contribute to innovative projects that push
          the limits of what web technologies can achieve. My goal is to not only meet the expectations
          of clients and users but to surpass them, delivering solutions that are both elegant and effective.
